In  the times where the aviation industry is characterised by a dynamic environment and ever-changing demand, our Fly-Price predictor model aims to solve this question for consumers, including YOU!
"When should I book my flight to get the cheapest one?"

We have constructed five models (Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, XG Boost, SVM, KNN) and selected the most optimal model among them, with high accuracy tailored for forecasting price levels in the airline sector in India. Using built in machine learning algorithms in sci-kit learn and data analysis methodologies including hyper parameter tuning, ensemble methods we wanted to deliver a solution that consumers can use while booking price tickets that suits their economical needs.

Our model has real world significance and practical applications attached as it has been trained on a recent post-COVID dataset i.e. from February 11th to 31st March 2022.
The airline companies can utilise our insights to make informed business decisions.
